A controlled anonymous chat app.

## Disclaimer
This project is developed under NUS Orbital Program (Independent development) 2017. 
Due to shift of technology, there'll  be no update on this project. Please refer to https://github.com/IzHoBX/Angels-Mortals for a new version of the same app. 

## Intro
Hudat allows you to talk to your friends anonymously. For shy guys out there who dare not to talk to new friends, this is your chance! Or if you want to give your boss a constructive feedback but afraid of being marked down, Hudat gives you the courage!

Hudat is not like any other anonymous chat app. In Hudat, you are only approached by people who you know in the real world. Instead of having thousands of new friends, we believe that enhancing existing relationships is a better option!

Hudat is developed natively on both Android and iOS. This repo stores only the Android version.
